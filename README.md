If you dissatisfied with G Hub Control Assignments feature and need more control for your beloved G604, then you are lucky, because you can see more potential of G604 as ultimate productivity mouse. 

Logitech G604 has 9 control on top and 6 control on side, if you are using G Hub, at most you can assign 29 programmable control (with G-Shift feature).

But with AHK script you can at least make (9 * (6 + 1 )) + 6 => **69** (nice..) programmable control *(by sacrificing your numpad button)*, and here i will show you how to unleash that potential.
