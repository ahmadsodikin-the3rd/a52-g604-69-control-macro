# Logitech G604 69+ Programmable Control with AHK
Unlock G604 potential as Ultimate Productivity Mouse.

If you are dissatisfied with G Hub Control Assignments feature and need more control for your beloved G604, then you are lucky, because you can see more potential of G604 as the ultimate productivity mouse.

Logitech G604 has 9 control on top and 6 control on the side, if you are using G Hub, at most you can assign 29 programmable control (with G-Shift feature).

But with AHK script you can at least make (6 * 10) + 9 = **69** (nice..) programmable control *(by sacrificing your numpad key)*, and here I will show you how to unleash that potential.

### Requirements:
- Logitech G604 Gaming Mouse : https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/gaming-mice/g604-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse.html
- G Hub : https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/innovation/g-hub.html
- AHK : https://www.autohotkey.com/

### How:
- Organize G604 side buttons as layers by its functionality, you can assume each layer as G-Shift so you can have 6 G-Shift buttons.
- Assign each side & extra buttons with numpad key in G Hub.
- Create macros with AHK based on combinations between numpad key and mouse buttons / scroll.
- Compile AHK script and place it in windows startup.
- Profit...

### Explaination:
- When you assign a side button as a layer, you can have at most 10 controls (9 controls on the top side & 1 assigned current side button).
- For example, when you press G8 (assigned Numpad 3) button, you will cycle tab / go to the next tab (depend on the app).
- But when you press and hold G8 button (assigned Numpad 3) then press right mouse button, you will close the current tab.
